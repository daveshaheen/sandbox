# Demo

Missing pieces

* hook up api and projects, they're a mess
* database connection string should be passed from api settings json file
* seed database
* add unit tests
* add regression tests
* add end to end testing
* powershell script for setup and tear down
* nginx maybe for serving ui or just load balancing and using razor pages or mvc for ui
* setup docker containers
* logging (serilog, kibana, elasticsearch)
* profiling and monitoring
* swagger for documenting the api
* css framework (material design or bootstrap with css modules)
* continuous integration
* browser support?
* big O check/refactor for performance
* idk I'm probably forgetting something
